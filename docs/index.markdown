# Governor Framework  

&nbsp;  

The Governor Framework is a simple, modular, and secure smart contract framework for creating on-chain decentralized autonomous organizations that scale from one participant to millions. It has been deployed over 1000 times, protects many billions of dollars in value and is used by nearly a million participants. 

Originally created by [Compound.Finance](https://compound.finance/) as Governor Alpha, and used as the decentralized control mechanism for their lending protocol, it has since been standardized in the [OpenZeppelin library of contracts](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts) as [OZ Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/governance).  

Other organizations, building on the security and modularity of Governor have adapted it to their needs. Originally an ERC20 token based system of governance, [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf/) adapted the contract to work with ERC721 (NFTs), a design which was later standardized and included in the OpenZeppelin contracts library as well. 

The Governor Framework is writen in [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/) and runs on all [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) based networks. As such, it has been deployed on many L1's and L2's as a powerful decentralized control mechanism for DAO's. 

Example organizations using the Governor Framework: [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Compound.finance](https://compound.finance/), [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), [ENS](https://ens.domains/), [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf/), [DopeWars](https://dopewars.gg/), [Hop](https://hop.exchange/), [AAVE](https://aave.com/), [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/), [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/).
